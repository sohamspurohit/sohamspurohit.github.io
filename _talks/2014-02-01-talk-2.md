• Determined and proved conditions necessary to achieve hypotrochoid patterns around a stationary point for two unicycles pursuing each other with equal and unequal velocities using a range-only control strategy<br>
• Devised a switching law to control the minimum and maximum radius of hypotrochoids generated by the pursuit<br>
• Extended the analysis to achieve patterns for multiple (more than two) unicycles with equal velocities<br>
