• Modeled a fixed, rotating ground robot as a smooth manifold and implemented an observer
design on Lie Groups to determine its orientation in the ground frame using Python<br>
• Plotted and compared the behavior of the observer and determined the optimal observer design based on the convergence rate, overshoot, and steady-state errors for the set of parameters<br>
• Observed faster convergence rate and lower overshoot compared to a standard Kalman Filter
