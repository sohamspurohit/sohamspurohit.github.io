• Devised methods to overapproximate the reachable sets of odeco Homogeneous Polynomial
Dynamical Systems (odeco-HPDS) using their exact solutions obtained using tensor algebra

• Formulated a zonotope decomposition method for odeco HPDS with zero and constant control

• Formalized a method to transform certain general (non-odeco) HPDSs to use our methods

• Displayed an improvement in performance over the existing reachability analysis tool, CORA in terms of tightness of overapproximations
