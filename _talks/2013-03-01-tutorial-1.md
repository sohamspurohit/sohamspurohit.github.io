• Devised methods to overapproximate the reachable sets of odeco Homogeneous Polynomial
Dynamical Systems (odeco-HPDS) using their exact solutions obtained using tensor algebra<br>
• Formulated a zonotope decomposition method for odeco HPDS with zero and constant control<br>
• Formalized a method to transform certain general (non-odeco) HPDSs to use our methods<br>
• Displayed an improvement in performance over the existing reachability analysis tool, CORA in terms of tightness of overapproximations
