• Designed experiments to evaluate the performance of an improved embedded magnetic shape-sensing system for the 3D bending of a single-segment, centimeter-scale, continuum robot<br>
• Designed and manufactured a continuum robot segment and an experimental setup in Solidworks and performed data acquisition using Arduino-Uno to obtain magnetic and inertial data as a part of the evaluation experiments<br>
• Reduced errors in bending angle by 12% through calibration and iterative design and development
