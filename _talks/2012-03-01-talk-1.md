• Formulated the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) Problem through conversion to a linear program followed by specific binary encoding of continuous variables for quantum annealing solvers <br>
• Determined various methods for constraint reduction such as removing redundancies, formulating and using the dual problem<br>
• Solved the 2 machines-2 jobs, and 3 machines-3 jobs problem on the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 Quantum Computer, using the hybrid and quantum annealers<br>
• Performed hyperparameter tuning for solution improvement and compared the results to simulated annealers.
