I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I work in the [Epureanu Research Group](https://epureanu.engin.umich.edu/) and the [Automotive Research Center](https://arc.engin.umich.edu/). I obtained an M.S. in Robotics from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, and a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB).

Research Goals
===
I enjoy applying innovative methods to interdisciplinary fields, emphasizing developing mathematical intuition behind every approach. I love to formulate and solve mathematically intricate problems and arrive at solutions to problems through simulations and experiments. My areas of interest are -

1) Reinforcement Learning

2) Multi-agent Systems
   
3) Control Theory
   
4) Robotics
   
5) Applied Mathematics

Please contact me if you want to collaborate on research projects in any related fields.
