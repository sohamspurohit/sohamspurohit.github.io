I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I am part of the [Epureanu Research Group](https://epureanu.engin.umich.edu/) and the [Automotive Research Center](https://arc.engin.umich.edu/). I hold an M.S. in Robotics from the University of Michigan and a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

My work sits at the intersection of **dynamics**, **control**, and **decision-making**: I am interested in how we can design and analyze systems that learn, coordinate, and adapt—whether in manufacturing, robotics, or multi-agent settings. I draw on tools from reinforcement learning, nonlinear and optimal control, and applied mathematics, with an emphasis on rigor and interpretability.

## Research interests

- **Reinforcement learning** — sequential decision-making and policy optimization  
- **Multi-agent systems** — coordination, cooperation, and emergent behavior  
- **Control theory** — nonlinear dynamics, reachability, and observer design  
- **Robotics** — perception, planning, and applications in mobility and manipulation  

## Experience and affiliations

I have had the opportunity to work with research and industry groups across academia and R&D, including the **Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**, the **University of Michigan**, the **University of Toronto**, the **Automotive Research Center**, and the **Isuzu Technical Center of America**. These roles have spanned theory, simulation, and implementation in robotics and control.
