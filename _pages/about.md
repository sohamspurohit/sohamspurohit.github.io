I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I work in the [Epureanu Research Group](https://epureanu.engin.umich.edu/) and the [Automotive Research Center](https://arc.engin.umich.edu/). I obtained an M.S. in Robotics from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, and a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB). In my free time, I love playing (table tennis, squash, football) and watching (almost all) sports. I also like reading fiction and listening to rock music.

## Research Goals

I enjoy applying innovative methods to interdisciplinary fields, emphasizing developing mathematical intuition behind every approach. I love to formulate and solve mathematically intricate problems and arrive at solutions through simulations and experiments.

My areas of interest are:

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Multi-agent Systems**
- **Control Theory**
- **Robotics**
- **Applied Mathematics**

## Organizations I've Worked With

I've had the privilege of working with several leading institutions and research groups, where I contributed to projects in robotics, control theory, and multi-agent systems.
