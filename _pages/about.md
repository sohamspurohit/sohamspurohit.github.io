I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I work in the [Epureanu Research Group](https://epureanu.engin.umich.edu/) and the [Automotive Research Center](https://arc.engin.umich.edu/). I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning and control theory when applied to multi-agent systems. I obtained an M.S. in Robotics from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, and a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB).
