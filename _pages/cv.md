Research Experience
======
* **Job-Shop Scheduling Using Quantum Annealing**  
  *Prof. Bogdan Epureanu | Epureanu Research Group*  
  University of Michigan, USA  
  January 2024 – Present  
  - Formulated the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) Problem through conversion to a linear program followed by specific binary encoding of continuous variables for quantum annealing solvers
- Determined various methods for constraint reduction such as removing redundancies, formulating and using the dual problem
- Solved the 2 machines-2 jobs, and 3 machines-3 jobs problem on the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 Quantum Computer, using the hybrid and quantum annealers
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for solution improvement and compared the results to simulated annealers.

* **Reachable Sets of HPDS Using Exact Solutions**  
  *Prof. Ramnarayan Vasudevan | ROAHM Lab*  
  University of Michigan, USA  
  August – December 2023  
  - Devised a novel method for overapproximating the reachable sets of orthonormally decomposable Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems (odeco-HPDSs) with zero and constant control using exact solutions obtained through tensor theory
- Demonstrated significant improvement over Continuous Reachability Analyzer (CORA), the current state-of-the-art for reachability analysis of dynamical systems in terms of tightness of the overapproximations

* **Multi-agent Pattern Generation Using Only Range**  
  *Prof. Arpita Sinha | Dept. of Systems and Control*  
  IIT Bombay, India  
  August 2022 – June 2023  
  - Determined and proved conditions necessary to achieve hypotrochoid patterns around a stationary point for two unicycles pursuing each other with equal and unequal velocities using a range-only control strategy
- Devised a switching law to control the minimum and maximum radius of hypotrochoids generated by the pursuit
- Extended the analysis to achieve patterns for multiple (more than two) unicycles with equal velocities

  May – July 2022  
  - Designed experiments to evaluate the performance of an improved embedded magnetic shape-sensing system for the 3D bending of a single-segment, centimeter-scale, continuum robot
- Designed and manufactured a continuum robot segment and an experimental setup in Solidworks and performed data acquisition using Arduino-Uno to obtain magnetic and inertial data as a part of the evaluation experiments
- Reduced errors in bending angle by 12% through calibration and iterative design and development

* **Kalman Filtering on Lie Groups**  
  *Prof. Ravi Banavar | Dept. of Systems and Control*  
  IIT Bombay, India  
  May 2021 – May 2022  
  - Modeled a fixed, rotating ground robot as a smooth manifold and implemented an observer
design on Lie Groups to determine its orientation in the ground frame using Python
- Plotted and compared the behavior of the observer and determined the optimal observer design
based on the convergence rate, overshoot, and steady-state errors for the set of parameters
- Observed faster convergence rate and lower overshoot compared to a standard Kalman Filter
