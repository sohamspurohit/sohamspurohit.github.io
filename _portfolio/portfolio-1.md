title: "Advanced Engineering Intern - Powertrain"
excerpt: "• Assisted in the development (MiL/HiL) of the temperature control of the after-treatment system (ATS) of a commercial diesel engine using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to reduce NOx emissions and optimize fuel injection <br/>
• Improved MPC controller results by modifying problem setup in Simulink and modifying the problem formulation for the real-time custom solver tool FORCESPRO, bringing the results closer to the baseline <br/>
• Set up CAN communication protocol between ECU and PC, and developed and flashed MPC control algorithm on ECU for HiL testing<br/><img src='/images/isuzu.png'>"
